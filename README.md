This repository includes a step-by-step implementation of a cloud-based AI agent using **AWS Bedrock**, inspired by the tutorial:

📺 **YouTube Tutorial:** [Build a Cloud-Based AI Agent with AWS Bedrock and LangChain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk42ZYMgmk) by *Josh Werner*

🛠️ **Features Implemented**:

* Setup of AWS Bedrock environment
* Integration with LangChain
* AI agent that reads external data (e.g., from GitHub README files)
* Example use case: Analyzing customer reviews for an imaginary company

This tutorial is a great starting point for deploying generative AI agents using serverless infrastructure and scalable language models.
