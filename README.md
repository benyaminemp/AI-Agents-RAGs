# AI-Agents-RAGs
An AI agent is a software system that can perceive its environment, reason about it, and take actions to achieve specific goals — often autonomously. Modern AI agents use large language models (LLMs) to understand natural language, interact with tools or APIs, and perform tasks like data analysis, customer support, and decision-making. Here, there is a tutorial for AWS Bedrock that can help to implement a cloud-based AI agent to make a business assistant.

### 🧠 Cloud-Based AI Agent Tutorial (AWS + LangChain)

This repository includes a step-by-step implementation of a cloud-based AI agent using **AWS Bedrock**, inspired by the tutorial:

📺 **YouTube Tutorial:** [Build a Cloud-powered AI Agent for Business Assistance with Amazon Bedrock](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk42ZYMgmk) by *Hadelin*

🛠️ **Features Implemented**:

* Setup of AWS Bedrock environment
* Example use case: Business Assistance

This tutorial is a great starting point for deploying generative AI agents using serverless infrastructure and scalable language models.
